# odin-landing-page

In this project I will be building a basic web page using HTML and CSS while incorporating Flex-box as well. This project is apart of the The Odin Project CSS and Flex-box sections of the foundations curriculum. 

This project will demonstrate my knowledge of basic HTML principles like the boilerplate, working with text, lists, links and images, and git. This project will also demonstrate my knowledge of basic CSS like styling elements, fonts, inline and block elements, and other fundamental CSS properties. finally, this project will also demonstrate my understanding of basic Flex-box principles as I use it to layout the webpage as well as manipulate elements and containers to make the webpage look how the project intends.
